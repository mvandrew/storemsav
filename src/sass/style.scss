Store MSAV is the perfect theme for any WooCommerce project.

Parent theme Storefront originally designed and developed by WooCommerce Core developers. However, additional features were added to accelerate the launch of new e-commerce projects.

Theme features a bespoke integration with WooCommerce itself plus many of the most popular customer facing WooCommerce extensions.

There are several layout & color options to personalise your shop, multiple widget regions, a responsive design and much more.

This theme, like WordPress, is licensed under the GPL.
Use it to make something cool, have fun, and share what you've learned with others.

Resetting and rebuilding styles have been helped along thanks to the fine work of
Eric Meyer http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/index.html
along with Nicolas Gallagher and Jonathan Neal http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/

All sizing (typography, layout, padding/margins etc) are inspired by a modular scale that uses 1em as a base size with a 1.618 ratio.
