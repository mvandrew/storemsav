## Storefront theme resources
* Storefront theme [Documentation](https://docs.woocommerce.com/documentation/themes/storefront/).
* Official parent theme [GitHub repository](https://github.com/woocommerce/storefront).

## Frameworks
* Grid-layout based on [Susy engine](http://oddbird.net/susy/) for Sass. [Susy3 Documentation](http://oddbird.net/susy/docs/). [Susy1/Susy2 Documentation](http://susy.readthedocs.io/). In my opinion, the documentation for version 2 is much better.
* CSS Framework based on [Compass](http://compass-style.org/). (deprecated)
* Used a simple and lightweight mixin library [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) for Sass. See Bourbon [Documentation](http://bourbon.io/docs/).
